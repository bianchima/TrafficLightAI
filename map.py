This file will contain the parser for getting map data from text files,
and converting it into a complete map object which can be used for training.
Each map object contains multiple intersection objects, containing behavioral
instructions for each car as it reaches the intersection. These behaviors are
parsed from the behavior text file, and are specific for a particular layout.
